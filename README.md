### About Me
Hi, I'm Ronda! I'm a computer science student at Renton Technical College, planning to transition into backend or full-stack software engineering. I previously worked in international education, mostly on internship and study abroad programs to Germany. During my CS studies, I've been managing a kayak and paddleboard rental during summer and work at a kayak gear shop in the off-season.
